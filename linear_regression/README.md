Linear regression in one or multiple variable can be used to model a relationship between variables and their outcomes/dependent variables.

f' =  Wx +b

cost = f - f'

SGD  => min (cost)

Gradient descent is used to minimize the cost function. SGD works by changing the parameters according to direction of negative gradients so as to minimize the cost.
